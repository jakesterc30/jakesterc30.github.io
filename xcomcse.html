                <p class="lead">Com 2 is the sequel game to XCOM: Enemy Unkown by Firaxis Games. It is a turn-based strategy RPG that revolves around resource and unit management while trying to retake the earth from its new alien overlords.</p>
                <p>This is a game that I will always go back to. I have over 300 hours clocked into the prequel, XCOM: Enemy Unknown and plan on draining even more than that into XCOM 2. Each playthrough of the game feels different and is different.</p>
                <p>XCOM 2 has in-depth character customization and the lore goes deep as well. The story flows smoothly from the first game, and previous characters have special guest appearances as well! I am not trying to spoil too much of the story, but the DLC gives characters you love and know good story arcs.</p>
                <p>The gameplay takes a huge step up from the prequel, as the classes have the same core gameplay, but have many more activatable abilities that, in my opinion, enhance the quality of the gameplay and uniqueness of each class.</p>
                <p>All in all this game is a solid sequel. It scales the difficulty up a bit from the first game at higher levels, but also provides a great experience for all players. The multiplayer is solid, but the matchmaking is weak. It takes a very long time to find a game to play. However, the multiplayer is a very small part of this game, so I would rate it a 9/10.</p>
